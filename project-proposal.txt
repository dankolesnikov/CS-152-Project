Project Proposal

Idea: Compare 4 datasets of flight data over 4 years. Analyze the data by finding the top 5 airline carriers that had the biggest delay times in 2004 and compare it to the performance in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008. See if those airlines have improved. 

Framework: Cascalog
Language: Clojure
Dataset: Flight Data - http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html
Dataset size: Over 1 million rows per dataset

Metrics we are looking at:
Average delay Time
Average Number of bounced flights
Response to increased load during holiday flights i.e Summer and Winter Break
Average Delay YOY

Display of data will be done using a javascript graphing library:

We would like to meet with you to narrow down the scope of the project, get your input on the idea.
