# CS 152 Project: Cascalog

## Overview

Compare 4 datasets of flight data over 4 years. Analyze the data by finding the top 5 airline carriers that had the biggest delay times in 2004 and compare it to the performance in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008. See if those airlines have improved. 

Metrics we are looking at:
Average delay Time
Average Number of bounced flights
Response to increased load during holiday flights i.e Summer and Winter Break
Average Delay

## Week 2 Tasks

To Do:

* Need to figure out the architecture:
	* How do we connect Hadoop / Cascalog ?
	* How to connect cascalog with web server for data visualization?
	* Should we use web front end for data visualization or some java plotting library?
		* If going with web, how do we connect cascalog and webserver? or ust use .csv? 
* Start coding!
