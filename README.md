### Danil

* I've researched Clojure programming language and installation guide for the kernel for Jupyter Notebooks. I suggest using it if it works well with the Cascalog framework. It will be easier to collaborate on the code. 
* Installed Clojure IDE: Nightcode (no feedback yet)
* Installed Cursive clojure plugin for IntelliJ
* [Kernel for Notebooks](https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter)

Useful Learning Materials:

* [Learn Clojure in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/clojure/)


**Terminal commands for setting up Clojure Kernel for Jupyter Notebooks(Mac):**

	brew install clojure
	brew install leiningen
	git clone https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter
	cd clojupyter
	make
	make install

## Week 2 Report

To Do:

* Need to figure out the architecture:
	* How do we connect Hadoop / Cascalog ?
	* How to connect cascalog with web server for data visualization?
	* Should we use web front end for data visualization or some java plotting library?
		* If going with web, how do we connect cascalog and webserver? or ust use .csv? 
* Start coding!
